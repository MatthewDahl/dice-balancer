# Dice Balancer

An app that displays the probability of the given dice, empowering the user
to alter the dice in order to strike a balance that fits their needs.

## Repo Structure

Starting off simple with a monorepo approach that keeps our front-end `client`
in the same respository as our back-end `services`.

```plain
.
├── .github
│   └── ...templates, actions, etc....
├── client
│   └── ...src...
└── services
    └── service_name_01
        └── ...src...
    └── service_name_02
        └── ...src...
```
